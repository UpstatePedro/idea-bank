    "\n",
    "**Simple search** might be the most obvious & basic attempt to solve that task. It starts at the first element, and moves through them one-by-one, in sequence, until it finds the right answer. If our desired value happens to be the first element, then we're in luck. If it isn't, and our list is long, then we might have to check a lot of values before we get our answer...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Binary search** dramatically reduces the number of values we have to check before we find the position of our desired element. At each step it selects the mid-point of the remaining elements and establishes whether that location is too low or too high in order to determine which elements it can remove from consideration, and which elements are still contenders (remember, it's a sorted list). This process is repeated with each step until we find the target value (or exhaust the possibilities)."
