    "Probability is used to quantify our uncertainty concerning unknown events or phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty comes in 2 different flavours:\n",
    "1. **Epistemic** (also, model uncertainty): originates due to our imperfect understanding of the processes that we are modelling. Colleting more, and better, data can help to reduce this.\n",
    "2. **Aleatoric**: originates in the intrinsic variability of these processes. Collecting more data won't change this.\n",
    "\n",
    "ie. we can become extremely confident that our model correctly understands a process, but if it tells us that there's an 80% chance of outcome A and 20% chance of outcome B, then there is still uncertainty in any prediction that we make.\n",
